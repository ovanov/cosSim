# cosSim - Compare your text files with cosine similarity!

It is hard to determine how similar two text files are.  Without much complication, cosSim uses simple tokenization and vectorization with which a word similarity can be calculated.

This is very usefull in cases where the context is not important, but the spelling has a big impact (as in OCR with pdf files).
